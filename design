  isLost = false 
  
obstacle: 
  coordinates 
  time
  
UserInterface:
  coordinates,
  edges, 
  input 
  
 
 this is just so I remember to do it 
 
 Still need to do, user interface, coordinates, edges, input. 
 I got rid of two of the dinosaurs because I think it makes it too complicated
 
 I'd like to add in an ability to play online, and have user accounts. Also a saving function. 
 
 I could do that via a database because I miss working with SQL. 
 
 If I were going to do a database we'd have something in 2nf like: 
 
 User
 _____
 ID     pk
 Name
 Pass
 Average Score
 High Score
 GameID fk 
 
 
 Game
 ____
 GameID pk
 Timer
 Score
 State (I'd have to find some way to store state. Maybe it's own table, Probably XML file though)

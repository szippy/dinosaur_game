dinosaurs: an exercise in oop concepts in Java

The dinosaur game is a game that I like to use to get used to the OOP functions of any given programming language. 

The requirements for the game are: 

at least 4 subclasses of the monster
try some sort of algorithm (flocking this time) to control monster movement
allow user to choose between AI controlled and user controlled
accept user input 
character has health and damage
some sort of music (don't bitch out this time) 
some sort of obstacles to avoid

Going forward I need to start working on: 
The exact behavior of movement for:
  Users
  Dinosaurs
Map creation, and GUI

Damage, Counters, and Drawing. 

Menus 

Saving function eventually?

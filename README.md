dinosaurs: an exercise in oop concepts in Java

The dinosaur game is a game that I like to use to get used to the OOP functions of any given programming language. 

The requirements for the game are: 

at least 4 subclasses of the monster
try some sort of algorithm (flocking this time) to control monster movement
allow user to choose between AI controlled and user controlled
accept user input 
character has health and damage
some sort of music (don't bitch out this time) 
some sort of obstacles to avoid

Build out requirements and psuedocode while working on python problems in the other repo. 
Then I'll start working on this more
